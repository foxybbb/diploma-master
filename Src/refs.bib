ABSTRACT = {Path planning creates the shortest path from the source to the destination based on sensory information obtained from the environment. Within path planning, obstacle avoidance is a crucial task in robotics, as the autonomous operation of robots needs to reach their destination without collisions. Obstacle avoidance algorithms play a key role in robotics and autonomous vehicles. These algorithms enable robots to navigate their environment efficiently, minimizing the risk of collisions and safely avoiding obstacles. This article provides an overview of key obstacle avoidance algorithms, including classic techniques such as the Bug algorithm and Dijkstra’s algorithm, and newer developments like genetic algorithms and approaches based on neural networks. It analyzes in detail the advantages, limitations, and application areas of these algorithms and highlights current research directions in obstacle avoidance robotics. This article aims to provide comprehensive insight into the current state and prospects of obstacle avoidance algorithms in robotics applications. It also mentions the use of predictive methods and deep learning strategies.},

abstract = {The Boreas dataset was collected by driving a repeated route over the course of 1&nbsp;year, resulting in stark seasonal variations and adverse weather conditions such as rain and falling snow. In total, the Boreas dataset includes over 350&nbsp;km of driving data featuring a 128-channel Velodyne Alpha-Prime lidar, a 360° Navtech CIR304-H scanning radar, a 5MP FLIR Blackfly S camera, and centimetre-accurate post-processed ground truth poses. Our dataset will support live leaderboards for odometry, metric localization, and 3D object detection. The dataset and development kit are available at boreas.utias.utoronto.ca.},
