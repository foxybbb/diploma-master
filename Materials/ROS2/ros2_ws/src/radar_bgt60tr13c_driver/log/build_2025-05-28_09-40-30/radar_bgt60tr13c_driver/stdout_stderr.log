[33mCMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:27 (add_executable):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target radar_publisher_node
  because there is a cycle in the constraint graph:

    dir 0 is [/]
    dir 1 is [/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/radar_bgt60tr13c_driver/radar_sdk/build/bin/lib]
      dir 0 must precede it due to runtime library [libsdk_algo.so]
      dir 2 must precede it due to runtime library [libsdk_avian.so]
    dir 2 is [/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/radar_bgt60tr13c_driver/radar_sdk/libs/linux_x64]
      dir 0 must precede it due to runtime library [libsdk_algo.so]
      dir 1 must precede it due to runtime library [libsdk_base.so]
    dir 3 is [/opt/ros/humble/lib]

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
